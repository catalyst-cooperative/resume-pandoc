# Work Experience

## Catalyst Cooperative

Data Scientist
: Dec 2021 - Present

- Develop Public Utility Data Liberation (PUDL) project - open source data pipeline for public energy data, work with ETL, orchestration, CI/CD best practices
- Built machine learning framework for entity matching between FERC and EIA datasets, work funded by Climate Change AI
- Used LayoutLM to extract Ex. 21 tables from unstructured SEC 10K filings in order to map parent companies to subsidiary utility companies, work funded by Mozilla Technology Fund
- Brought in multiple new client leads and wrote grant applications

## PRO Unlimited for Google

Data Science Contractor
: Summer 2021

- Cleaned, aggregated, and pipelined big datasets from various climate and energy data sources into Google’s Data Commons web platform
- Processed and integrated results from Stanford’s DeepSolar and DeepEJ models and terabytes of IPCC climate projection data into the Data Commons central database
- Learned and worked with Data Commons schema and Google version control practices

## National Renewable Energy Lab

Energy Modeling Intern
: Summer 2019

- Worked with ReEDS model team on North American power system capacity planning from present day to 2050
- Co-authored paper “The Potential for Using Local PV to Meet Critical Loads during Hurricanes” in Solar Energy Research

## Upstream Tech

Software Engineering Intern
: Summer 2018

- Paired coastal wetland land data with satellite imagery to build machine learning model predicting wetlands health variables
- Model used in partnership with Environmental Defense Fund to

# Research

## Dr. Arun Majumdar Lab

**Sep 2020 - Sep 2021**

### Power Grid Vulnerability Mapping

- Machine learning model mapping predictions of power grid vulnerability to climate change induced events across the US
- Aggregated climate/weather, socioeconomic, and power grid data from disparate sources into feature vectors
- Aim to create early stage identifier of energy justice hot spots
- Wrote initial concept proposal, multiple grants for the project, wrote code for model architecture, generated primary results
- Presented weekly updates to lab members as well as project funding sources

### EJSCREEN + DeepSolar Analysis

- Paired data from the EPA’s EJSCREEN tool with locations of non-residential solar from lab’s DeepSolar model
- Preliminary findings show correlations between socioeconomics (income, race, education level) and proximity to non-residential solar projects
- Potential use for Biden administration’s environmental justice and infrastructure initiatives
