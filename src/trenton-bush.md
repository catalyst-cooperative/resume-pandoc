# Work Experience

## Catalyst Cooperative

Data Wrangler
: 2021 – present

Data warehousing, analysis and model development at an energy data consultancy

- Developed and deployed an end-to-end document analysis system to extract both tabular and key/value data from nearly 5 million pages of scanned documents. Achieved over 95% recovery rate.
- Unified distinct power plant datasets from EPA and EIA by using a network analysis model to connect power plant components between the datasets.
- Translated product desires from non-technical clients to technical requirements for internal staff.
- Board member – managed and analyzed organizational finances and capacity.

## Altosphere Analytics

Data Scientist
: 2019 - 2020

Product development for a renewable energy IoT data management startup.

- Built time series anomaly and event detection system, including causal attribution for various sensor issues.
- Reduced new customer deployment time from 3 months to 3 weeks by designing data-efficient models.
- Designed interpretable metrics and reporting for non-technical users, including front end UI and dashboard

## K2 Management, Inc

Energy Analyst
: 2017 - 2019

Energy production forecasting and tool development for a global renewable energy consultancy.

- Created and maintained ETL pipelines for a terabyte-scale weather and energy data warehouse
- Developed internal python tools to replace and enhance existing Excel-based analysis flows
- Saved client $1.8 million NPV by building a time series classifier to identify misconfigured turbines
- Advised clients on sensitivity and uncertainty in hybrid statistical/physics-based forecast models
- Led internal research into machine learning and presented at the international WindEurope 2019 conference

## University of Massachusetts Amherst

Graduate Research Assistant
: 2013 - 2016

Fully funded research to design, build, and test a supersonic powder spray deposition system from scratch.

- Developed an approximate model for prototyping, with 99% shorter run time vs full physics simulations
- Numerically optimized and empirically validated a supersonic nozzle for a novel deposition material. Reduced energy use 85% vs existing commercial systems

# Projects

## [Air Quality](https://www.github.com/TrentonBush/air_quality)

**2021**

- A from-scratch solution for real-time air quality monitoring using commodity hardware
- Wrote embedded device drivers, integrated with time series database, monitored with live dashboard

## [Turbulence Spectra](https://www.github.com/TrentonBush/turbulence_spectra)

**2021**

- Independent research project to assess the impact of turbulence on wind energy production. Scoped and designed experiment, found source data, spectral analysis of 1TB meteorological time series dataset.
- Implemented custom CV splitter to mitigate data leakage due to autocorrelation (blocking and buffering)
