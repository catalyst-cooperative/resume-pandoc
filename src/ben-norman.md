# Education

Cornell Tech, New York NY
: Computer Science, ME; 2019.

Cornell University, Ithaca NY
: Computer Science, BS (Music minor); 2018.

# Work Experience

## Catalyst Cooperative

Data Engineer
: Aug 2021 - Present

Catalyst creates and maintains an open source data pipeline that automatically cleans, integrates, validates, and publishes US energy data for climate advocates, researchers and journalists.

## Envelope

Data Scientist
: Aug 2019 - Aug 2021

Envelope combines predictive analytics with the most accurate 3D modeling of zoning laws to identify land acquisition opportunities. I create models to value buildings, understand ownership networks, and analyze market changes.

## Department of City Planning NYC

Data Engineer
: Jun 2019 - Aug 2019

Worked on the ETL of NYC public datasets including the cityâ€™s parcel, facility and environmental review datasets. I also volunteered at planning community hearings.

## Jenny Sabin Design Lab

Research Associate
: Jun 2016 - Jun 2018

Worked on a software project called RoboSense that enables architects to easily design and use intelligent Arduino controlled end effectors for 6 axis robots in Grasshopper and Rhino. Co-authored two papers that were accepted to SimAUD 2016
and Acadia 2018.

## Autodesk

Machine Learning Intern
: Jun 2017 - Aug 2017

Implemented a variational autoencoder to encode Generative Design shapes as vector representations to calculate similarity and cluster 3D generated models. Utilized traditional computer vision techniques for shape vector representation. Researched
a 3D model recommendation system.

# Publications

- Robosense 2.0: Robotic Sensing and Architectural Ceramic Fabrication: Acadia 2018
  - Presented the paper in Mexico City and received a Student scholarship award.
- Matrix Architecture: 3D-Printed and Simulated Kirigami Matrices & Auxetic Materials: SimAUD 2017

# Skills

Python, Pandas, Dagster, Github Actions, GCP, Docker, Geospatial Python

# Projects

### Gridle

**December 2023 - Present**

I created a [silly game](https://gridle.bendnorman.com/) inspired by Wordle where you have to guess a US state given it's electricity generation fuel mix.

### NYC Affordable Opportunity

**Aug 2017 - May 2018**

A project analyzing the distribution of new affordable units in areas of opportunity in NYC. Only a quarter of new affordable units built since 2014 in NYC are in moderate to very high economic opportunity tracts.

### Image Captioning Machine Learning Research

**Cornell University**

I worked on a research project to improve image captioning by implementing a loss function that computers semantic similarity between captions using Word Movers Distance. We were advised by Professor Kilian Weinberger.

# Hobbies

Climbing, Music (Saxophone, Keyboard, Guitar), Cooking and crafting.
