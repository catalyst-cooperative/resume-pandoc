# Projects

The [SatStress](https://github.com/zaneselvans/satstress) Python package implements the geophysical and geomorphic models I developed over the course of my PhD between 2004 and 2010. It was released under the GPLv3 open source license. A decade later it continues to be used and built upon by other researchers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory as well as other institutions (See e.g. [SatStressGUI](https://github.com/SatStressGUI/SatStressGUI)).
